What is an Object?
You may be wondering what an object is and what you would ever need to use one for. Well if you've ever used a Scanner to get input from a user then you have used an object before. In fact you've most likely used dozens of objects before without even knowing it. An object is a kind of data type that you use to complete a specific task or store data about a specific entity. Objects have certain traits and certain behaviors that make them different from other objects. Think of an object in programming as any old object in the real world, for example a car. What traits does a car have? Well a car has a make, model, color, and mileage (obviously there are more traits for a car but we're just going to cover the basics). What behaviors does a car have? A car starts, goes forward, goes reverse, parks, and turns off. These are the most basic of features a car has, obviously there are other objects that are more simple then a car, like a switch. A switch has only two traits, on or off and has two behaviors, close the circuit or open it. When you create a software object you will be doing this exact process, determining what traits the object should have (also known as fields or attributes) and what behaviors the object will perform (also known as methods or functions).
