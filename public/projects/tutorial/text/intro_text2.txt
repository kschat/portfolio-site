Introduction:
To start things off I'm going to go over what you will and what you won't learn in this tutorial. First off I won't be covering anything about inheritance in this tutorial, this is strictly a beginners tutorial on how OOP works and I don't want to be throwing too much information right off the bat. Depending on how well this tutorial turns out I will create a part two that goes over more advanced topics like inheritance, and polymorphism. This tutorial WILL cover the basics of creating your own objects, good practices for creating objects and why using OOP over procedural oriented programming is much more efficient and better.
